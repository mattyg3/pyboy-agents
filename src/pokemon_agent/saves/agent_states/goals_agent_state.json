The current map is PALLET_TOWN, and there's a direct doorway to OAKS_LAB. So the next step should be to use that doorway. The example response for entering a house uses the destination name, like \"Enter 'BLUES_HOUSE'\". So here, the action would be \"Enter 'OAKS_LAB'\".\n\nWait, but the Longterm Goal says \"Return parcel to Oak in OAKS_LAB\". So maybe they need to go there first. The current map has a doorway to OAKS_LAB, so the next action is to enter that. The Map Doorways list shows 'OAKS_LAB' as a destination, so the correct action is to enter OAKS_LAB.\n\nBut wait, the user might need to check if there's a path or if they need directions. However, the problem says to select the next best action from the provided options. Since the Map Doorways include OAKS_LAB, the immediate action is to enter it. The example responses show using the destination name for doorways.\n\nSo the answer should be \"Enter 'OAKS_LAB'\". But wait, the Longterm Goal is to return the parcel to Oak there, so maybe they need to go there first. The current map is PALLET_TOWN, and there's a direct doorway to OAKS_LAB, so that's the next step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user needs to check directions first? But the problem says to use the tool if needed. Wait, the tool is get_directions, which is for checking directions between points. But in this case, the Map Doorways already list OAKS_LAB as a possible destination, so maybe no tool call is needed here.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"Use available tool to determine which map connections and doorways to use.\" But in this case, the Map Doorways already specify that OAKS_LAB is accessible from PALLET_TOWN. So the next action is to enter OAKS_LAB.\n\nThe example responses show that for doorways, you use the destination name.

Also, there are NPCs: OAK (two entries) and a GIRL.\n\nThe Scratch Pad shows that the previous move was entering OAKS_LAB from PALLET_TOWN. So they're now in OAKS_LAB.\n\nThe Longterm Goal has two parts: first return the parcel to Oak here (since they're already in OAKS_LAB), then go to BLUES_HOUSE to get the Town Map. But the current map is OAKS_LAB, so the first step is probably to interact with Oak.\n\nLooking at the Map NPCs, there's an OAK NPC with text 'TEXT_OAKSLAB_OAK1' and another with 'TEXT_OAKSLAB_OAK2'. The user needs to return the parcel to Oak here, so they should talk to Oak.\n\nWait, the example responses show that for NPCs, you use the name. So the next action would be \"Talk to 'OAK'\".\n\nBut let me check if there's a need to use the get_directions tool. The problem says to use the tool if needed. The current map's Map Connections are empty, so they can't move via directions. The goal is to talk to Oak first. Since the Map NPCs list OAK, the next action is to talk to Oak.\n\nThe user's Longterm Goal says \"Return parcel to Oak in OAKS_LAB\", so they need to interact with Oak here. The NPC list shows OAK is present, so the correct action is to talk to Oak.\n\nNo tool call needed here because the action is directly from the NPCs list.

The Map Doorways have two entries to LAST_MAP, but maybe that's not helpful here. The Map NPCs include OAK and a Girl.\n\nFrom the Dialog History, they just talked to OAK, who said he wants them to borrow a Town Map from his sister. The last message from OAK was: \"I'll tell her not to lend you one to lend you one\". So the next step is probably to get the Town Map from BLUES_HOUSE.\n\nBut wait, the current map is OAKS_LAB. To get to BLUES_HOUSE, they need to move through the map connections. However, the Map Connections list is empty here, which means they can't move in any direction.

Maybe LAST_MAP is the town where BLUES_HOUSE is located. But the problem is that the user needs to get to BLUES_HOUSE. Let me think.\n\nWait, the example says that when traveling NORTH, you use the labeled SOUTH entrance. But here, the Map Connections is empty, so they can't move. But they have doorways to LAST_MAP. Maybe they need to use one of those doorways to exit OAKS_LAB.\n\nThe Map Doorways list shows two doorways to LAST_MAP. So perhaps LAST_MAP is the main town map, like PALLET_TOWN.

Maybe LAST_MAP is the town map (like PALLET_TOWN). So they need to use one of the doorways to go back to the town.\n\nThe example says that to enter a map like VIRIDIAN_FOREST, you use the SOUTH_GATE. So here, the doorways to LAST_MAP might be exits from OAKS_LAB. So the next step would be to exit OAKS_LAB via one of the doorways to get back to the town.\n\nBut the user's goal is to get to BLUES_HOUSE.

So the next action would be to \"Enter 'LAST_MAP'\" via one of the doorways. But the example response for doorways uses the destination, so \"Enter 'LAST_MAP'\".\n\nWait, but the user's goal is to get to BLUES_HOUSE, which is in the town. So after exiting OAKS_LAB, they'll be in the town (LAST_MAP), then they can go to BLUES_HOUSE.\n\nBut the current game state's Map Connections is empty, so they can't move in any direction. So the only possible action here is to use a doorway to exit the current map.\n\nSo the next action should be to enter LAST_MAP via one of the doorways. The example response for doorways is \"Enter 'destination'\".\n\nSo the answer would be \"Enter 'LAST_MAP'\".\n\nWait, but the user's long-term goal is to get the Town Map from BLUES_HOUSE. So after entering LAST_MAP (the town), they need to find BLUES_HOUSE. But the current step is in OAKS_LAB, so the next action is to exit to the town.\n\nYes, so the next action is to use the doorway to LAST_MAP.

But the Scratch Pad shows they've been in OAKS_LAB and BLUES_HOUSE, so maybe they need to head towards the main route.\n\nThe Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN have a north connection to Route1. The Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City, which is in the east. So maybe they need to go north first to Route1, then proceed east.\n\nBut the user's current map is PALLET_TOWN. The next step would be to move north to Route1. However, the example responses show that actions are like \"Move to 'NORTH'\", using the direction from Map Connections.\n\nWait, the Map Connections list has direction: 'north' with target_name 'Route1' and target_label 'ROUTE_1'. So the action here would be \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nBut let me check the Scratch Pad. The previous moves show they went to OAKS_LAB, talked to OAK, then tried to enter LAST_MAP (which might be a mistake), then entered BLUES_HOUSE, talked to DAISY, then entered LAST_MAP again. Now they're back in PALLET_TOWN.\n\nThe user's goal is to get to Pewter City. The next logical step is to head north to Route1, which is the main path towards the east. So the next action should be moving north.\n\nWait, but in the game, after Pallet Town, the next town is Route 1, then you go to the next towns. So moving north from Pallet Town to Route1 makes sense.\n\nThe Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN have north as Route1. So the correct action here is \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they need to check directions using the get_directions tool. But the problem says: \"Use get_directions tool_call if you need to check directions from point_a to point_b\". However, in this case, the Map Connections already list the north direction as Route1, so maybe no tool call is needed.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"If you need to check directions from point_a to point_b, use get_directions\". But here, the Map Connections already specify the north direction leads to Route1, so perhaps the next action is to move north.\n\nLooking at the example responses: \"Move to 'NORTH'\" is a valid action.\n\nThe Scratch Pad shows that previous moves were entering OAKS_LAB and BLUES_HOUSE, but now they're back in PALLET_TOWN. The next step should be to move north to Route1 to start heading towards Pewter City.\n\nSo the answer should be \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"Output Restrictions: MUST select an action from the provided options in 'Current Game State'\". The Current Game State's Map Connections have the north direction, so the action is \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nYes, that's the next best action."

The user is playing a Pokemon game and needs to decide the next action based on the current game state.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the Current Game State provided. The Longterm Goal is to travel to Pewter City, train and catch Pokemon until they have a level 15 Pokemon, then defeat Brock at Pewter Gym. The Dialog History shows that they've already gotten a Pokedex from Oak and a town map, so they're probably in the early stages.\n\nCurrent Map is Route_1. The Map Connections here have two directions: north to ViridianCity (target_label VIRIDIAN_CITY) and south to PalletTown (PALLET_TOWN). The Map Doorways are empty, so no doorways to enter. The Map NPCs are two Youngsters.\n\nThe Scratch Pad shows previous moves: they were in Pallet Town, entered Oak's Lab, talked to Oak, then went to Blues House, talked to Daisy, and then moved north from Pallet Town to Route_1. Wait, the last entry in Scratch Pad is 'current_map': 'PALLET_TOWN', 'llm_decision': \"Move to 'NORTH'\". But according to the Current Game State, the current map is Route_1. Hmm, maybe the Scratch Pad is a bit confusing here.\n\nWait, the Current Game State says Current Map is Route_1. The Scratch Pad shows previous moves leading up to moving north from Pallet Town to Route_1. So now they're on Route_1.\n\nThe Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. But Route_1 is near Pallet Town (where they started), and Pewter City is further east. Wait, in the game, Route 1 is the first route after Pallet Town. The next step would be to head towards the next town.\n\nBut looking at the Map Connections for Route_1: north is Viridian City, south is Pallet Town. Wait, Viridian City is a big city, but Pewter City is another city. Maybe the user is confused here. Wait, in the game, after Pallet Town, you go to Route 1, then Route 2, etc., but Pewter City is in the east.\n\nWait, the Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. So the user needs to travel through the routes to get there. But the current map is Route_1, which connects to Pallet Town (south) and Viridian City (north). But Viridian City is in the south, and Pewter City is in the east. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the game, the order is Pallet Town -> Route 1 -> Route 2 -> ... -> Pewter City. But according to the Map Connections here, Route_1's north is Viridian City, which is a bit confusing because Viridian City is a different city. Maybe this is a simplified version.\n\nBut the user's goal is Pewter City. So they need to go east from Route_1. However, the Map Connections for Route_1 only show north and south. So maybe they need to use the get_directions tool to check possible paths.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Use get_directions tool_call if you need to check directions from point_a to point_b\". The user needs to figure out the next step. Since they're on Route_1, and the goal is Pewter City, they need to move east. But the Map Connections here don't have east or west directions. Wait, the Map Connections list has north and south, but the user's action options are based on the Map Connections.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"Map Connections: Lists all of possible maps connected to the current map. **IF** this is empty, you **cannot** use ['NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', or 'WEST']\". In this case, Map Connections has north and south, so they can use those directions.\n\nBut the user's goal is Pewter City. The current map is Route_1. The next step would be to go south back to Pallet Town? But that seems counterproductive. Wait, the Scratch Pad shows that they moved north from Pallet Town to Route_1. So they came from Pallet Town to Route_1. Now they need to go further east.\n\nWait, maybe the Map Connections here are labeled differently. For example, in the game, Route 1 connects to Pallet Town (south) and Route 2 (north). But in this data, the north connection is labeled as Viridian City. Hmm, perhaps this is a simplified map.\n\nAlternatively, the user needs to check directions to see where Pewter City is. But the get_directions tool requires specific map names. The user needs to know which direction leads to Pewter City.\n\nWait, the Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. The current map is Route_1. The next step would be to move east, but according to the Map Connections, there's no east or west listed. So maybe the user needs to use the get_directions tool to find the correct path.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"When traveling NORTH, you will likely need to use the labeled SOUTH entrance for the target map\". So for example, to enter a map from the south, you use the north connection.\n\nBut in this case, the user is on Route_1. The Map Connections show north to ViridianCity (VIRIDIAN_CITY) and south to PalletTown (PALLET_TOWN). But Pewter City is not listed here. So perhaps the user needs to go further east through other routes.\n\nWait, maybe the user should move south back to Pallet Town to get the town map, but the Scratch Pad shows they already have a town map. Alternatively, they need to proceed east.\n\nWait, the problem says that the user's next action must be selected from the Current Game State's options: Map Connections (north/south), Map Doorways (empty here), or Map NPCs (two Youngsters).\n\nThe user's goal is to get to Pewter City. So they need to move east. But the Map Connections don't have east or west. So perhaps the answer is to move north to Viridian City? But that's not Pewter City.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the data. Alternatively, the user should check directions to see which path leads to Pewter City.\n\nThe problem says: \"Use get_directions tool_call if you need to check directions from point_a to point_b\". So the user should call get_directions to find the path to Pewter City.\n\nBut the tool requires specific point_a and point_b. The user needs to know which map names to use. For example, maybe they need to check from Route_1 to Pewter City.\n\nBut the current map is Route_1, and the target is Pewter City. However, the get_directions function's description says it's for getting directions from point_a to point_b in a graph. So the user should call get_directions with start as the current map (Route_1) and end as Pewter City.\n\nWait, but the tool's parameters are start and end as strings. The user needs to specify the map names. In the game, the map names might be like 'PEWTER_CITY' or 'PEWTER_CITY_MAP'.\n\nWait, the example in the problem mentions 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE' as a gate. So the map names might be in a specific format.\n\nBut the user's current map is Route_1. The Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. So the next step would be to use get_directions from Route_1 to Pewter City to see the path.\n\nBut the problem says: \"TOOL_CALL: get_directions from POINT_A to POINT_B\". So the answer here would be to call the tool with start as 'Route_1' and end as 'PEWTER_CITY'.\n\nWait, but the user's current map is Route_1, so POINT_A is Route_1, and POINT_B is Pewter City.\n\nBut the problem states that the user must select the next best action. If they need to check directions, they should call the tool.\n\nLooking at the Scratch Pad, the previous move was moving north from Pallet Town to Route_1. Now they're on Route_1. The next step would be to move east, but the Map Connections don't list east. So perhaps they need to check directions to see which path leads to Pewter City.\n\nWait, the Map Connections for Route_1 have north to ViridianCity and south to PalletTown. But Pewter City is in the east, so maybe the user needs to go through other routes. However, the tool call would help determine the correct path.\n\nSo the correct action here is to call get_directions from Route_1 to Pewter City.\n\nBut the problem says: \"provide clear, valid map names when calling\". So the start is 'Route_1' and end is 'PEWTER_CITY'.\n\nWait, but in the game, the map names might be different. For example, in the game, the cities have specific names like 'PEWTER_CITY' or 'Pewter City'.\n\nGiven the problem's example, like 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE', the map names might be in a specific format. But the user's goal is Pewter City, so the end point is 'PEWTER_CITY'.\n\nSo the tool call would be get_directions from 'Route_1' to 'PEWTER_CITY'.\n\nBut the problem says: \"When traveling NORTH, you will likely need to use the labeled SOUTH entrance for the target map\". So maybe the user needs to check the directions to see the correct path.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to call the get_directions tool with start as 'Route_1' and end as 'PEWTER_CITY'.\n\nWait, but the user's current map is Route_1, so the start is Route_1, and the end is Pewter City.\n\nYes, so the tool call should be: get_directions from Route_1 to PEWTER_CITY.\n\nBut the problem says the output must be exactly 'TOOL_CALL: get_directions from POINT_A to POINT_B'.\n\nSo the answer is: TOOL_CALL: get_directions from Route_1 to PEWTER_CITY\n\nWait, but the problem's example uses 'NORTH' as the direction, but here it's a tool call.\n\nWait, the user's task is to select the next best action. If they need to check directions, they should call the tool. Otherwise, they choose an action from the current map.\n\nIn this case, since they need to know the path to Pewter City, they should call the tool.\n\nSo the output should be the tool call."

Let me check again.\n\nThe Scratch Pad has entries like:\n\n{'current_map': 'PALLET_TOWN', 'llm_decision': \"Move to 'NORTH'\"}\n{'current_map': 'ROUTE_1', 'llm_decision': 'TOOL_CALL: get_directions from Route_1 to PEWTER_CITY'}\n... and then another TOOL_CALL, then \"Move to 'SOUTH'\".\n\nBut the current game state's Current Map is PALLET_TOWN. Wait, the problem says \"Current Game State\" has Current Map: 'PALLET_TOWN'. So the user is currently in PALLET_TOWN.\n\nThe Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. The user needs to travel there. From PALLET_TOWN, the north connection is Route1, south is Route21.\n\nIn the Scratch Pad, the previous move was moving to 'NORTH' from PALLET_TOWN, which took them to ROUTE_1. Then they did two tool calls for directions from Route1 to Pewter City, then moved south. But now, the current map is PALLET_TOWN again? Wait, the Scratch Pad shows that after moving south from Route1, they might have returned to PALLET_TOWN? Hmm, maybe the current state is PALLET_TOWN again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the Current Game State has Current Map: 'PALLET_TOWN'. So the user is back in PALLET_TOWN now.\n\nThe next step is to figure out what to do. The Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. The user needs to find the path there.\n\nIn the Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN, the north is Route1. Route1 is a common path towards Pewter City. The south is Route21, which might be a different route.\n\nThe user has already done some tool calls from Route1 to Pewter City. But since they're back in PALLET_TOWN, maybe they need to go north again to Route1.\n\nWait, the Scratch Pad shows that the last action was moving to 'SOUTH' from Route1, which would take them back to PALLET_TOWN (since Route1 connects to PALLET_TOWN's south? Wait, no. The Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN have north to Route1 and south to Route21. So Route1 is north of PALLET_TOWN, Route21 is south.\n\nWhen you move north from PALLET_TOWN, you go to Route1. When you move south from PALLET_TOWN, you go to Route21.\n\nIn the Scratch Pad, after moving north from PALLET_TOWN to Route1, they did tool calls for directions from Route1 to Pewter City. Then they moved south from Route1, which would take them back to PALLET_TOWN (since Route1's south connection is PALLET_TOWN? Or maybe Route1 connects to other routes).\n\nBut the current state says Current Map is PALLET_TOWN, so they must have come back here.\n\nThe next best action would be to go north again to Route1 to start heading towards Pewter City.\n\nBut the user needs to check directions from Route1 to Pewter City. Wait, the tool call was already done in the Scratch Pad. The user might need to confirm the path.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"select the next best action\". The available actions are based on Map Connections, Map Doorways, Map NPCs.\n\nIn PALLET_TOWN, the Map Connections allow moving north to Route1 and south to Route21. The Map Doorways are to Red's House, Blue's House, Oak's Lab.\n\nThe Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. The most direct path from PALLET_TOWN is north to Route1, then following that route towards Pewter City.\n\nThe user has already done tool calls from Route1 to Pewter City, but maybe they need to move north again.\n\nWait, the Scratch Pad shows that the last action was moving to 'SOUTH' from Route1, which would take them back to PALLET_TOWN (since Route1's south connection is PALLET_TOWN? Or maybe Route1 connects to other routes). But according to the Current Game State's Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN, the north is Route1, so moving north from PALLET_TOWN goes to Route1.\n\nSo the next step is to move north to Route1 again.\n\nBut the user needs to check if there's a better path. However, the tool calls were already made from Route1 to Pewter City. The response from the tool call would show the directions.\n\nWait, the problem says that if you need to check directions, use get_directions. But in this case, the user is in PALLET_TOWN, and they want to go to Pewter City. The direct path is via Route1.\n\nThe next action should be to move north to Route1.\n\nBut looking at the Scratch Pad, the previous move was moving south from Route1, so they're back in PALLET_TOWN. So the next action is to move north again.\n\nThe example responses show that for Map Connections, the action is \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nSo the answer here would be \"Move to 'NORTH'\".\n\nWait, but the user might need to check directions first. However, the Scratch Pad shows that they already did tool calls from Route1 to Pewter City. The current state is PALLET_TOWN, so they need to go north to Route1.\n\nThe problem says: \"select the next best action\". The available actions are based on the current map's connections.\n\nIn PALLET_TOWN, the Map Connections have north to Route1. So the next action is to move north.\n\nTherefore, the output should be \"Move to 'NORTH'\"."

            "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is playing a Pokemon game and needs to decide the next action based on the current game state.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the Current Game State provided. The Longterm Goal is to travel to Pewter City, train and catch Pokemon until level 15, then defeat Brock at Pewter Gym. The Dialog History shows they've already gotten a Pokedex from Oak and a town map, so they're probably in the early stages.\n\nCurrent Map is Route_1. The Map Connections here have north to ViridianCity and south to PalletTown. The Map Doorways and NPCs are empty for this map. The Scratch Pad shows previous moves: they moved from PalletTown to Route_1 by going north, then tried to get directions from Route_1 to Pewter City.\n\nWait, the user's last action was moving to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, which would take them back to PalletTown. But the Scratch Pad shows that after moving to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, they're now in PalletTown again. Now, the current state is Route_1 again? Wait, no. Let me check the Scratch Pad entries.\n\nLooking at the Scratch Pad:\n\n- Previous moves: they were in PALLET_TOWN, moved north to ROUTE_1 (since Route_1 is north of PalletTown). Then they did a TOOL_CALL for directions from Route_1 to Pewter City twice. Then they moved to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, which would take them back to PalletTown. Now the current map is Route_1 again? Wait, the Scratch Pad shows:\n\n{'current_map': 'ROUTE_1', 'llm_decision': \"Move to 'SOUTH'\"}\n\nAfter that move, the next current_map would be PalletTown. But the current state given here says Current Map is 'ROUTE_1'. Hmm, maybe the Scratch Pad is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the Current Game State provided in the problem has Current Map as 'ROUTE_1'. So the user is currently on Route_1. The Map Connections here are north to ViridianCity and south to PalletTown.\n\nThe Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. But Pewter City is in the Kanto region, and Route 1 is near Pallet Town (where the player starts). The next step after Pallet Town is usually Route 1, then Route 2, etc., but the player needs to get to Pewter City.\n\nWait, in the game, after Pallet Town, you go to Route 1, then Route 2, etc., until you reach Pewter City. But the player's current map is Route_1. The Map Connections here show that south leads to PalletTown (which they've already been to), and north leads to ViridianCity. But Viridian City is a different region (the player is in Kanto, so Viridian is in the same region but further east).\n\nWait, but the player's goal is Pewter City, which is in the Kanto region, east of Pallet Town. So maybe the correct path is to go south from Route_1 to Pallet Town, then east through other routes to Pewter City.\n\nBut the Scratch Pad shows that they tried to get directions from Route_1 to Pewter City. The tool call was made twice, but the response isn't shown here. The user needs to figure out the next step.\n\nThe problem says that the next best action should be selected from the Current Game State options: Map Connections (north/south), Map Doorways (empty here), or Map NPCs (there are two youngsters).\n\nThe user's Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. So they need to move towards that. But the current map is Route_1. The Map Connections here have south to PalletTown (which they've already been to) and north to ViridianCity. But Viridian City is in the same region as Pewter City? Wait, no. In the game, Pewter City is the first gym in Kanto, and Viridian City is a different city (the first gym in the game is Pewter, then Viridian is later). Wait, maybe the game's map is structured differently.\n\nWait, in the game, after Pallet Town, you go to Route 1, then Route 2, then Route 3, etc., until you reach the next town. But the player's goal is Pewter City, which is the first gym. So the correct path would be to go east from Pallet Town through Route 1, then Route 2, etc.\n\nBut in the current state, the player is on Route_1. The Map Connections here show that south is PalletTown (which they've already visited) and north is ViridianCity. Wait, that seems odd because in the game, Route 1 is between Pallet Town and Viridian City? Or maybe the game's map is different.\n\nWait, the problem states that the player's Longterm Goal is to travel to Pewter City. So they need to get to Pewter City. The current map is Route_1. The Map Connections here have south to PalletTown and north to ViridianCity. But Pewter City is not directly connected here. So perhaps the player needs to go south to PalletTown and then proceed east through other routes.\n\nBut the Scratch Pad shows that they tried to get directions from Route_1 to Pewter City. The tool call was made, but the response isn't provided here. The user needs to decide the next action.\n\nThe available actions here are:\n\n- Move to 'NORTH' (to ViridianCity)\n- Move to 'SOUTH' (to PalletTown)\n- Talk to the two youngsters (but their text is in the Map NPCs)\n\nThe player's goal is Pewter City. If they go north to ViridianCity, that's a different city (Viridian is in the game, but Pewter is further east). So probably the correct move is to go south back to PalletTown and then proceed east.\n\nWait, but the Scratch Pad shows that after moving to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, they were in PalletTown. Now, the current state is Route_1 again. So maybe they need to go south to PalletTown and then from there, move east to Route 2, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the next best action should be selected. The user has to choose between the available options.\n\nThe Map Connections here are north and south. The player's goal is Pewter City, which is east of Pallet Town. So going south to PalletTown might be a step back, but perhaps they need to go south to PalletTown and then move east through the town.\n\nWait, but in the game, after Pallet Town, you go to Route 1, then Route 2, etc. So maybe the player is supposed to go south to PalletTown (which they've already been to) and then proceed east from there.\n\nBut the current state is Route_1. The player's next move should be to go south to PalletTown to get back to the town where they can proceed east.\n\nAlternatively, the player might need to use the get_directions tool to check the path from Route_1 to Pewter City. But the user already made two tool calls for that. The problem says that the next action should be selected.\n\nWait, the problem states that the user must select the next best action from the Current Game State options. The options are:\n\n- Move to 'NORTH' (if Map Connections has north)\n- Move to 'SOUTH' (if Map Connections has south)\n- Talk to NPCs (the two youngsters)\n\nThe player's goal is Pewter City. Since they're on Route_1, and the Map Connections show south to PalletTown (which they've already been to), but they need to get to Pewter City, which is east of Pallet Town, the next logical step would be to go south to PalletTown and then move east from there.\n\nBut the current map is Route_1, so the next action would be to move south to PalletTown. However, the Scratch Pad shows that they just moved to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, so they're now in PalletTown. But the current state says Current Map is Route_1, so perhaps the user is back on Route_1.\n\nWait, the problem's Current Game State has Current Map as 'ROUTE_1', so the user is here. The previous move was moving to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, but the current state is Route_1 again. Maybe the tool call was made, and the user needs to decide.\n\nThe Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. The player needs to find the path. Since they tried to get directions from Route_1 to Pewter City, but the tool call might not have given a direct path, the next step could be to move south to PalletTown to start the journey east.\n\nBut the Map Connections here have south to PalletTown. So the next action would be \"Move to 'SOUTH'\".\n\nWait, but the Scratch Pad shows that they did move to 'SOUTH' from Route_1, which would take them to PalletTown. Now, the current state is Route_1 again? Maybe the game state is reset or there's a loop.\n\nAlternatively, the user needs to check directions from Route_1 to Pewter City. But they already made two tool calls. The problem says that the next action should be selected.\n\nGiven the options, the best action here is to move south to PalletTown to start the journey towards Pewter City. So the next action would be \"Move to 'SOUTH'\".\n\nWait, but the problem says that the user must select from the Current Game State's options. The Map Connections here have south as a direction to PalletTown. So the answer is \"Move to 'SOUTH'\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they should move north to ViridianCity, but that's probably not the right path. Since Pewter City is east of Pallet Town, moving south to PalletTown and then east is the way to go.\n\nYes, so the next action is to move south to PalletTown."

The Map Doorways include Red's House, Blue's House, and Oak's Lab. The NPCs here are a Girl and a Fisher.\n\nThe Scratch Pad shows previous moves. The last few entries indicate that they moved back and forth between PALLET_TOWN and ROUTE_1. The most recent move was moving to 'NORTH' from PALLET_TOWN, which took them to ROUTE_1. Then they moved south from ROUTE_1 back to PALLET_TOWN. Now they're back in PALLET_TOWN again.\n\nThe user's current map is PALLET_TOWN again. The Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City. From the Scratch Pad, they tried using get_directions from Route_1 to Pewter City but maybe that's not helpful now. Since they're in PALLET_TOWN, they need to figure out the best path.\n\nIn the Map Connections, the north direction leads to Route1. The south leads to Route21. But the goal is Pewter City, which is further south, I think. Wait, in the Pokemon games, Pewter City is south of Pallet Town. So maybe moving south from PALLET_TOWN would take them towards Pewter City? But the Map Connections here show south as Route21. Hmm, Route21 might be a different route.\n\nWait, the example in the General Map Connection Information mentions that VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE is the southern entrance to VIRIDIAN_FOREST. So maybe the route numbers here are specific. Route1 is probably the first route after Pallet Town, leading towards the next towns.\n\nBut the user's goal is Pewter City. In the game, after Pallet Town, you go through Route 1 to get to Viridian City, but Pewter City is the first gym city. Wait, no, Pewter City is the first gym city in the game. Let me think. In the original Pokemon Red/Blue, Pallet Town is the starting town, then you go to Route 1, then to Pewter City.\n\nWait, the user's Longterm Goal is to get to Pewter City.

The Current Game State's Map Connections for PALLET_TOWN have north to Route1 and south to Route21. The user needs to get to Pewter City, which is south of Pallet Town in the game. Wait, no, in the game, Pewter City is south of Pallet Town? Let me confirm.\n\nIn the original Pokemon games, after Pallet Town, you go north to Route 1, then south to Pewter City. Wait, no, actually, Pewter City is the first gym city, and the route from Pallet Town to Pewter City is Route 1, which is a straight line south. Wait, maybe the map connections here are labeled differently.\n\nBut according to the problem's example, when traveling north, you use the labeled south entrance for the target map. Hmm, maybe the direction labels here are a bit confusing.\n\nThe user's previous move was moving to 'NORTH' from PALLET_TOWN, which took them to ROUTE_1. Then they moved south from ROUTE_1 back to PALLET_TOWN. Now they're back in PALLET_TOWN.
