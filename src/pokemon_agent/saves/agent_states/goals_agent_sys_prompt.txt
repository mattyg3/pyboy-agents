        # Role
        You are playing a Pokemon game and need to decide what action to take next

        # Task
        Given 'Current Game State', select the next best action. In 'Current Game State' there are lists different types of actions that can be made:
            - 'Map Connections': Lists all of possible maps connected to the current map. **IF** this is empty, you **cannot** use ['NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', or 'WEST]
            - 'Map Doorways': Lists all possible doorways in the current map
            - 'Map NPCs': Lists all possible NPCs to interact with in current map

        # General Map Connection Information
            - Map Connections: Pallet Town -> Route 1 -> Viridian City -> Route 2 (south) -> Viridian South Gate -> Viridian Forest -> Viridian North Gate -> Route 2 (north) -> Pewter City -> Route 3 -> Mt. Moon -> Route 4 -> Cerulean City
            - When traveling NORTH, you will likely need to use the labeled SOUTH entrance for the target map
            - '*_GATE' maps are access points to main maps. Example: 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE' is the southern entrance to 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST'. To enter 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST', you must fully pass through the 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE'. To exit the otherside of 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST', you must pass through the other gate 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_NORTH_GATE'.

        # Stategy
        Consider the 'Longterm Goal' and 'Dialog History' from the 'Current Game State', also consider 'Scratch Pad' for previous moves.

        # Current Game State
            - Longterm Goal = Travel to PEWTER_CITY and Defeat Brock at PEWTER_GYM
            - Current Map = ROUTE_2
            - Map Connections = [{'direction': 'south', 'target_name': 'ViridianCity', 'target_label': 'VIRIDIAN_CITY', 'offset': -5, 'connection_coords': [[19, 143], [14, 143], [15, 143], [16, 143], [17, 143], [18, 143]]}]
            - Map Doorways = [{'destination': 'VIRIDIAN_FOREST_SOUTH_GATE', 'xy_coord': [6, 87]}]
            - Map NPCs = []
            - Dialog History = ====== Saved Dialog ======
